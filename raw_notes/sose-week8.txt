Restful services

Restful services are like pyramid


Communication and coordination decisions include deciding on 
microservice communication protocols, data sharing, whether services 
should be centrally coordinated, and failure management. 
The RESTful architectural style is widely used in microservice-based 
systems. Services are designed so that the HTTP verbs, GET, POST, PUT 
and DELETE, map onto the service operations.
The RESTful style is based on digital resources that, in a microservices 
architecture, may be represented using XML or, more commonly, JSON.
Continuous deployment is a process where new versions of a service 
are put into production as soon as a service change has been made. It is a 
completely automated process that relies on automated testing to check 
that the new version is of ‘production quality’.
If continuous deployment is used, you may need to maintain multiple 
versions of deployed services so that you can switch to an older version if 
problems are discovered in a newly-deployed service

XML is strict, json is more flexible and support numbers

Services analysis is done by data

tools for process mining can mad it easy


Process logs (transaction log) (Kibana and logstash you know that) <case-ID, task-ID, time-stamp, resource> (application.log/access.log ) (this is fup in ct)

Event logs (something happen) (state of change on business objects) (newrelic)

process logs can tell us bottlenecks

can tell us about patterns, risk , attacks (newrelic dashboards)


As a by-product of process mining, we can 
annotate mined process models with a 
range of measures:
 How many process instances were executed
 How many times a given flow was taken
 Time span to complete each task and each 
process instance
 Revenue, cost associated with each flow
 Heat-maps that show bottlenecks in real-time

Process analytics is the mining and analysis of data generated 
by, and associated with, the execution of a process.

Predictive Analytics - make some prediction, based on forensic data (useful when creating new business) (long, cost, performance, problems)
Diagnostic Analytics - rca (finding causes for issues)
Prescriptive Analytics - Prescriptive analytics goes beyond prediction by providing recommendations for actions or decisions (giving reccomendation)
