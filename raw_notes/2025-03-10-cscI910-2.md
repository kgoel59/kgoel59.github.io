Exercise 1: 
Based on your own knowledge, discuss why different application types require specialized software 
engineering techniques to support their design and development.



Exercise 2: 
Consider the integration and configuration process model shown in Figure “Reuse-oriented software 
engineering”. Explain why it is essential to repeat the requirements engineering activity in the process.


Exercise 3: 
Suggest why it is important to make a distinction between developing the user requirements and 
developing system requirements in the requirements engineering process
