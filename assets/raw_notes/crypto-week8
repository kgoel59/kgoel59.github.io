The El Gamal Cryptosystem

difficulty of the discrete 
logarithm problem

The security of the secret key depends on the difficulty of the discrete 
logarithm problem directly. Hardness of DLP is the necessary condition for 
the security of El Gamal encryption.
• But it is unknown if DLP is the sufficient condition for the security of El 
Gamal encryption


pk -> g^x
ct -> (g^r, g^xr.m)

assume CDH problem is hard

m => C2/m = g^xr (C2 is cipher text)

Hardness of CDH is the sufficient condition for the one-way security of El Gamal 
encryption

 If one can solve the CDH problem, then it can decrypt without having to know 
the secret key. Hardness of CDH is the necessary condition for the security of El 
Gamal encryption.

El Gamal is IND-CPA secure

Z*p (large prime numbers)

80 bit secure => 1024 bit prime number
112 bit => 2048 prime
128 bit => prime


Fully Homomorphic Encryption
• Correctness: For all generated (pk,sk), all CT←Enc(pk, M), 
and all function f, we have 
Pr[Dec(Eval(pk,f,CT), sk)=f(M)]=1
• Security: Standard IND-CPA security.
• Construction: Existing FHE schemes are constructed from 
lattice and the concrete constructions are beyond the scope 
of this subject


Implementing PKE II
• El Gamal encryption is not naturally supported in main 
stream cryptography libraries like OpenSSL.
• You can implement it by using existing interfaces such as DH 
key exchange or DSA signature.
– You are not recommended to do this unless you have a strong 
reason

Key Exchange Protocol

pk enc scheme is more expensive than symetric keys (high bits in pk keys, 30 times larger than symmetric key)

pk to protect sym key
sym key to protect communication

not valid now, but more effitient than pke scheme

we are consider passive adversory only (that cannot change the communication)

all parties have agreed on a common group G of q and common generator g of G

key exchange can improve 33% (comunication cost) from El gamal
