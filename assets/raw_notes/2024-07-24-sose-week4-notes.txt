BPMN

Exception handling BPMN

The error thrown by the (End) Event will be caught by an Intermediate 
Event a higher level. 

Errors only move upward in the Process hierarchy

Orchestration

Orchestration describes how a single business 
entity (i.e. a process participant such as a buyer, 
shipper, seller, or supplier) does things.

(controller owns the workflow)

Choreography

A Choreography process depicts the 
interactions between two or more 
business entities

(no central  controller)


Semantic processes and services 


Challenges with BPMN

But the semantics of processes in terms 
of their effects are not explicitly described


Unable to determine from a process model 
in BPMN what the effects achieved by a 
process might be at any point in the process 
model.

(Functional) effects of a process
◼ (Non-functional) performance/Quality-of-Service factors 
of a Process

We need some more info which is not in standard

Effect Annotation

Why it is important

Compliance checking
ex - Admit critically injured patients into consultation 
in no greater than 15 minutes after triage

Establish inter-process relationships
ex - a change made to one business process can 
potentially affect a range of other processes that are 
related to the process being changed

Functional Effects
Given any point in a process model, we wish to 
determine (at design-time) what the effects of 
the process would be if it executed up to that point

non-deterministic (represented by a 
set of effect scenarios)


Effect annotations:
Analysts annotate each BPMN task with 
immediate effect annotations
These immediate effects are accumulated
(usually in an automated fashion) to obtain 
cumulative annotations describing:
◼ Functional effects up to that point in the process
◼ Non-functional propertie

Effect annotations can be:
◼ Informal (e.g. plain English)
◼ Formal (e.g., FOL (first order logic), LTL, CTL etc.)
◼ Controlled Natural Language: This involves 
specifying effects using a limited repertoire of 
strictly formatted natural language sentence 
patterns, which can be directly mapped to 
underlying formal assertions


Similar to ontology

effect scenario consists of

A single consistent cumulative effect assertion
A scenario label
An exclude set˳
