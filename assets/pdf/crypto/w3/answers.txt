Question 1. Assume that we use a good hash function H
s.t. H(K || M) can be modelled as a secure pseudorandom
function FK(M). Please show that MAC(K,M)=H(K||M) is a
secure message authentication code.

Security Goal
    Unforgeable: It is hard to generate a valid tag for a new message.

|| => concat

H(K || M) can be modeled as a blockcipher FK(M)

The correctness is guaranteed by the fact that the MAC algorithm is
deterministic. 

• The underlying blockcipher is assumed to be a
pseudorandom function (PRF), i.e., outputs of the
blockcipher is indistinguishable from random values.
• Previous tags will just be some random values, i.e.,
no one could learn any information about the key
from the tags.
• The task of generating a valid tag for a new message
is equivalent to generating a specific random value.
• Therefore, successfully attacking this MAC scheme is
as hard as guessing a random value of (e.g.) 128 bits.


correct

pseudorandom is deterministic

output of pseudorandom is indistinguishable from output of random


Suppose the function f is collision-resistant (and thus the hash function H is also
collision resistant). Let IV be fixed for all messages.
Show that MAC(K,M)=H(K||M) is forgeable under chosen-message attack.
Here K is as large as one message block.

H(K||M) is modeled as a blockcipher and in blockcipher IV is necessary for random values

• The underlying blockcipher is assumed to be a
pseudorandom function (PRF), i.e., outputs of the
blockcipher is indistinguishable from random values.
• If IV never repeats, then M will be masked with
random values. This will completely hide M.
• We will show why it is secure to xor M with
random values later.
• The probability that IV will repeat is negligible since it
is randomly sampled.

Query MAC M1
Recieve H = MAC(K,M1)
Compute f(H,M2) = t`
We have
MAC(K,M1||M2) = t`

we forge = M1 || M2
