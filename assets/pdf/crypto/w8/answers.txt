Ans 1

The scheme is not secure because even h^r is a random group elememnt and this f(h^r) is a random number in Z_q, it might not be uniform [log(q-1)] but string. For example if
q = 2^288 + 3
Then first bit of f(h^r) will always be 1 abd thus reveal fist bit of m


example

The last bit of m is always is 1 q is prime and xor will reveal the information for first bit

Injective (One-to-One): No two different elements in the domain map to the same element in the codomain.  every x is has a unique y

Surjective (Onto): Every element in the codomain is the image of at least one element from the domain. In other words, for every element 

every y has x


Bijective (One-to-One Correspondence): A function is bijective if it is both injective and surjective, meaning:

every x is has a unique y, every y has x



log2(q-1) give a bit string

with large q the r function is not uniform 2^228 / 2^ 229

CCA -> submit any different queries before obtain cypher text
CCA2 -> submit any different queries before,after obtain cypher text (more power)
