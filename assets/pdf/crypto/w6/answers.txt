Consider the padded RSA Encryption scheme, 
where the public key is 〈 N, e 〉 as usual, an encryption of 
an l-bit message m is computed by choosing uniform r and 
outputting c=(m || r)^e mod N, and the decryption of a 
ciphertext c first computes m’=c^d mod N and outputs the 
first l bits of m’. Please show that the scheme is not IND-CCA secure

public key is 〈 N, e 〉 
N -> Large Number
e -> public expo

(adversary can identify message from cypher text)
Setup: The challenger chooses a key pair (pk,sk) and pk is given to the adversary.
Phase 1: The adversary can choose any CT for decryption queries.

Challenge: The adversary chooses any two different messages M_0 and M_1. The 
challenger chooses a random c and computes the challenge ciphertext 

CT*=Enc(M_c, pk), 

which is given to the adversary.


(adversary can forge cypher text)
Phase 2: The adversary can choose any CT different from CT* for decryption queries.
Guess: The adversary returns the guess c’ and wins if c’=c.

challenge
N = 6 e=1 r=7

adversary
m1=42 m2=47

challenge
42||7^ 1 MOD 6

47||7 ^ 1 MOD 6

Ans

2^e * C = 2(m||r)^e mod N

2*(N+1)/2 = 1 mod N





Consider the padded RSA Signature scheme, 
where the public key is 〈 N, e 〉 as usual, a signature on a an 
l-bit message m is computed by choosing uniform r and 
outputting s=(m || r)d mod N, and the verification 
algorithm checks if the first l bits of se mod N is m. Please 
show that the scheme is not secure.

the adversary chooses random s and computes x=s^e mod N

then it sets the message m as first l bits of x amd )m,s) is a valide message signature pair.

m = x1*x2*x3...xl
