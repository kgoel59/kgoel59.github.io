I'm a Software Developer working remotely from Wollongong, Australia. Over the past 3+ years, I have garnered diverse experience in software development, functioning both as an individual and a freelancer, as well as collaboratively within a team. My skill set is dedicated to solving intricate problems, particularly those that captivate my interest.<br/><br/>
Currently, I am pursuing my master's degree while actively contributing to open-source projects.
