<br/>
I'm a Software Developer and Engineer with over 3 years of experience across software development, DevOps, and cloud infrastructure. I’ve worked on diverse projects—independently, as a freelancer, and within collaborative teams—solving complex problems that spark my curiosity.<br/><br/>

In addition to my background in scalable software systems, I bring over a year of hands-on experience in large language models (LLMs) through applied research and real-world projects. My technical toolkit includes Python, cloud architecture, MLOps, and DevOps practices, enabling me to bridge infrastructure with intelligent systems.<br/><br/>

I’m actively involved in open-source development and always eager to contribute to roles that sit at the intersection of AI engineering, DevOps, and data-centric systems.<br/><br/>
