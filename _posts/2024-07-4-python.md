   - **Operators** (arithmetic, comparison, logical, etc.)

   Covered

### 2. **Control Flow**
   - **Conditional Statements** (if, elif, else)
   - **Loops** (for, while)
   - **Break and Continue**

   Covered

### 3. **Functions**
   - **Defining Functions** (`def`)
   - **Arguments and Parameters**
   - **Return Values**

   - **Custom Exceptions**

   Covered

### 6. **File Handling**
   - **Reading from and Writing to Files**

   - **Classes and Objects**
   - **Attributes and Methods**
   - **Inheritance**
   - **Encapsulation**
   - **Polymorphism**
   - **Special Methods** (e.g., `__init__`, `__str__`, `__repr__`)

   Partially Covered (Classes and Objects)

### 9. **Decorators and Higher-Order Functions**
   - **Function Wrappers**
   - **Class Decorators**
   - **Partial Functions**

   Not Covered

### 10. **Concurrency**

   - **Memory Leaks**

   Not Covered

### 17. **Miscellaneous**
   - **Regular Expressions**
   - **Command-Line Arguments** (argparse)
   - **Context Managers**

   Not Covered

### Overall Overview

The course is excellent for beginners new to Python programming, providing a solid foundation. However, for experienced developers, it may not offer much new insight.

### My Thoughts

While I do feel a bit of regret that the course content was relatively basic for my level, it has been a useful refresher and reinforced my Python skills. On the bright side, Python is now my primary language, and the course has served its purpose in solidifying my foundation.
