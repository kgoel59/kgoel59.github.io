I’m currently writing this in my fourth semester.

I haven’t had the chance to convert my raw notes into a proper format yet, so here’s a brief overview instead.

### Likes:

This is a great subject for me, especially since I worked as a DevOps engineer before, so topics like microservice architecture are quite close to my heart.

One of my favorite parts of the course was learning about Archimate. It’s such a useful diagramming tool when working in corporate settings. Sadly, my previous company didn’t use it, but I can see how beneficial it would be for structuring complex systems.

### Dislikes:

There’s not much I can complain about. The project was engaging, and I enjoyed the hands-on experience. However, the exam was a bit of a challenge, and I just managed to pass it. I think there’s room for improvement in that area.

This version adds more structure and flow, making it easier to read while keeping it conversational. Let me know if you'd like further tweaks!
