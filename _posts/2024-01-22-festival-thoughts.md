Hello Everyone,

Today marked a momentous occasion for Hindus worldwide, and as one of them, I feel compelled to share this extraordinary day with you.

After a hiatus of 500 years, Lord Rama has returned to Ayodhya, and the experience has been nothing short of magical.

I must admit, prior to today, I didn't pay much attention to the temple issue. It wasn't that I lacked devotion, but I believed that God resides in our hearts, and the absence of a physical temple shouldn't be a cause for concern. Why create such a fuss?

Today, my perspective underwent a transformative shift, all thanks to one thing – the smile on Lord Rama's face. Witnessing that radiant smile on the statue made me realize that the temple was more than worth it. Even though I wasn't physically present in Ayodhya, catching a glimpse of that smile on television created a moment of unparalleled joy, temporarily resolving all my worries.

It seems I wasn't alone in feeling this surge of happiness; the entire country joined in the celebration. Streets were lined with food stalls, parades, and music, turning the day into a grand festival. I'm grateful to have been in my home country for this historic occasion.

Here's to the beautiful smile of Lord Rama that brought so much joy to us all.
