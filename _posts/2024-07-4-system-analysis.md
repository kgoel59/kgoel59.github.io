### Overall Review

I received only 60% for this subject, just passing. The reasons for this are multifactorial, but I primarily attribute it to overconfidence and a lack of discipline and planning.

**Overconfidence and Lack of Discipline**: Learning from past mistakes with Strategic Network Design, I focused on the project and, seeing that it was going well, neglected lectures and even started skipping them. Additionally, staying up late made it difficult for me to attend early morning classes.

**Planning**: I feel I took on too much responsibility in the project and was lenient with non-working members, which inadvertently incentivized their behavior. While my involvement kept the project on track, I failed to properly manage resources and support team members. It was a group project, and I neglected the importance of effective resource management and team dynamics.

### Lessons Learned

**Discipline**: Implement more discipline in your life. Learn from your mistakes, correct them, but do so with discipline and self-awareness to avoid repeating them. Don’t be overconfident when things are going well; stay mindful of your work.

**Planning**: Adhere to the plan and allow team members to handle their responsibilities. Guide them, but don’t take over their work. Let others grow, even if it deviates from your vision.
