I’m currently writing this in my fourth semester.

I haven’t had the chance to convert my raw notes into a proper format yet, so here’s a brief overview instead.

### Overview:

This is a good subject overall, with no major negatives. However, I found it somewhat repetitive, especially since I had covered similar concepts in my previous course on Machine Learning.

### What I Like:

I appreciated the opportunity to learn more algorithms and gain a deeper understanding of how they work, which enhanced my knowledge of big data analytics.

### What I Don’t Like:

There wasn’t much that I disliked, but the repetition was a bit much for me. I ended up skipping some of the later lectures because they focused on topics I had already covered in detail.
