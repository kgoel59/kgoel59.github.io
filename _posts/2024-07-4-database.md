7. **03objectdatamodel.pdf**: Examines object data models integrating object-oriented programming concepts into databases.
8. **04conceptualModeling.pdf**: Addresses conceptual modeling techniques for abstract database representations.
9. **04designpatterns.pdf**: Discusses design patterns for solving common database design problems.
10. **05FunctionalDependencies.pdf**: Explains functional dependencies and their impact on database structure.
11. **05relationaldatamodel.pdf**: Covers the relational data model, organizing data into tables (relations) with rows and columns.
12. **06DerivationsOfFunctionalDependencies.pdf**: Looks into functional dependencies' derivations and their effects on database normalization.
13. **06logicaldesign.pdf**: Focuses on translating conceptual models into logical schemas.
14. **07DatabaseNormalization_1.pdf**: Introduces database normalization to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.
15. **07databasedesignquality.pdf**: Discusses criteria for high-quality database design, including efficiency and maintainability.
16. **08DatabaseNormalization_2.pdf**: Continues the normalization discussion with additional normal forms.
17. **08introductiontosql.pdf**: Introduces SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying and manipulating relational databases.
18. **09IntroductionToTransactionProcessing_1.pdf**: Explains transaction processing basics, including ACID properties and concurrency control.
19. **09sqlddl.pdf**: Covers SQL Data Definition Language (DDL) commands for defining and modifying database structures.
20. **10IntroductionToTransactionProcessing_2.pdf**: Delves into advanced transaction processing aspects, including recovery and management.
21. **10sqldml.pdf**: Focuses on SQL Data Manipulation Language (DML) commands for querying and manipulating data.
22. **11demoRollbackCommitTransaction.pdf**: Demonstrates SQL commands for rolling back and committing transactions.
23. **12TransactionProcessingInSQL (1).pdf**: Explores transaction processing specifics in SQL.
24. **12TransactionProcessingInSQL.pdf**: Continues the topic of transaction processing with further examples and explanations.
25. **12select-2.pdf**: Discusses advanced SQL SELECT statements, including complex queries and data retrieval.
26. **13NoSQL.pdf**: Introduces NoSQL databases and their models, including document, key-value, column, and graph databases.
27. **13select-3.pdf**: Covers additional advanced SQL SELECT queries, including joins, subqueries, and set operations.
28. **14select-4.pdf**: Continues advanced SQL SELECT topics with more examples and use cases.
29. **15select-5.pdf**: Further explores advanced SQL SELECT statements and techniques for efficient data retrieval.
30. **16views.pdf**: Discusses SQL views, which are virtual tables created from queries to simplify complex queries and manage data security.
31. **17advancedddlanddml.pdf**: Examines advanced DDL and DML concepts, including complex database definitions and manipulation techniques.
32. **18archreldbserver.pdf**: Covers the architecture of relational database servers, including query processors and storage managers.
33. **19dbsecurity.pdf**: Discusses database security measures to protect data from unauthorized access and breaches.
34. **20discraccesscontrol.pdf**: Focuses on discretionary access control, granting permissions based on user roles.
35. **21usermanagement.pdf**: Covers user management, including creating and managing user accounts and permissions.
36. **22dataintegrity.pdf**: Discusses data integrity to ensure accuracy and consistency throughout data lifecycle.
37. **23datavulnerabilities.pdf**: Examines vulnerabilities in data management systems and common threats.
38. **24databaseauditing.pdf**: Explores database auditing practices for monitoring and recording activities.
39. **25dataprivacy.pdf**: Focuses on data privacy concerns and regulations to protect personal and sensitive data.
40. **26legalethicaldatamanagement.pdf**: Discusses legal and ethical considerations in data management, including compliance with laws and ethical standards.

### Overall Review

I was able to achieve a distinction with relatively little effort. Although the course was not particularly challenging, it provided valuable insights, particularly into object modeling.
