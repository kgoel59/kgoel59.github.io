Iâ€™m currently writing this in my fourth semester.

I havenâ€™t converted my raw notes into a proper format yet, so Iâ€™ll provide a brief overview instead.

The subject isnâ€™t particularly difficult, but it does require a lot of formalization and repetition of certain concepts.

### What I Like:

I enjoy how the course uses mathematical problems, such as prime factorization, the Discrete Logarithm Problem, and the Diffie-Hellman Problemâ€” all of which are NP problemsâ€”and applies them to the field of cryptography.  

Itâ€™s fascinating to see how these problems are utilized in cryptography. Iâ€™ve also experimented with algorithms on small inputs, which gave me a deeper appreciation for human ingenuity, while also realizing how much weâ€™re still teetering on the edge of the P vs NP dilemma.

### What I Donâ€™t Like:

While formalization is definitely key, I feel the course focuses too much on it, which sometimes detracts from the overall learning experience.  

Additionally, I think thereâ€™s a lack of detailed practical examples that would help in understanding how these concepts are applied in the real world.

Oh, and one more thing: when youâ€™re giving an online exam, please check the time twice. I literally missed an hour of the exam because of it. ðŸ˜… Scored a bit less because of this
