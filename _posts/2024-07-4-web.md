## Web Development

This course focused exclusively on frontend development.

### Overall Review

I achieved a High Distinction in this course with relatively little effort. However, I have some regrets about taking it.

### New Insights

I found XML DTD to be quite interesting, though it may not be as relevant in today’s web development landscape.
