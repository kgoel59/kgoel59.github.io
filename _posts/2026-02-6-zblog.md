Hey, so this will be another reflection note.

I have not updated this site from quite sometime , and I feel my writting and presentation style have shifted. 

These are the changes i made.

1. There is a panda now in front screen, from now he is the manager of site. 🐼
2. Remove the cv, it is looking too professional
3. Most of blogs are about uow, which was killing my enthusiasm to write more, so i changed the blog title.

Thanks for reading!
