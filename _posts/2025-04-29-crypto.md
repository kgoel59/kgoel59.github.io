## Course Reflection

### What I Like

I enjoy how the course uses mathematical problems such as **prime factorization**, the **Discrete Logarithm Problem**, and the **Diffie–Hellman Problem**—all NP problems—and applies them directly to cryptography.

It’s fascinating to see how these abstract problems are utilized in real cryptographic systems. I’ve also experimented with algorithms on small inputs, which gave me a deeper appreciation for human ingenuity, while also realizing how much we’re still teetering on the edge of the **P vs NP** dilemma.

### What I Don’t Like

While formalization is definitely key, I feel the course focuses *too much* on it at times, which can detract from the overall learning experience.

Additionally, there’s a lack of detailed **practical examples**, which would really help in understanding how these ideas are applied in the real world.

Oh, and one more thing: when you’re giving an **online exam**, please check the time twice. I literally missed **an hour** of the exam because of it 😅  
Scored a bit less because of that.

## Towards Modern Cryptography

### Modern Cryptography Concepts

#### Shannon Perfect Cipher

- Encryption:  
  `message ⊕ key → ciphertext`  
- Decryption:  
  `ciphertext ⊕ key → message`

#### Perfect Secrecy

A cryptographic system achieves **perfect secrecy** if the probability distribution of the plaintext, given the ciphertext, is the same as the a priori distribution of the plaintext.

Formally:

Pr[M = m] = Pr[M = m | C = c]


This means that observing the ciphertext provides **no additional information** about the plaintext.

#### Definition

For every pair of messages `m₀, m₁ ∈ M` and every ciphertext `c ∈ C`:

Pr[C = c | M = m₀] = Pr[C = c | M = m₁]


#### Shannon’s Theorem

In a system with perfect secrecy, **the number of keys must be at least equal to the number of messages**.

## Symmetric-Key Encryption & Block Ciphers

### Roadmap
- Classic Cipher → Caesar Cipher  
- One-Time Pad → Shannon  
- Designing Block Ciphers  

### Design Principles

#### Confusion & Diffusion
- **Confusion:** A small change in the key causes a significant change in ciphertext  
- **Diffusion:** A small change in plaintext causes a significant change in ciphertext  

This behavior is known as the **avalanche effect**.

### Block Cipher Model

Message → Enc(key) → Ciphertext → Dec(key) → Message


- Typical block sizes: **64-bit, 128-bit**
- Iterated ciphers use **rounds** (DES: 16, AES: 10)

---

### DES (Data Encryption Standard)

**Why it was developed**
- Need for a standard encryption scheme in the 1970s

**Design Goals**
- High security  
- Compliance with Kerckhoffs’s principle  
- Economical  
- Adaptable  

**Technical Details**
- 64-bit input/output  
- 56-bit key  
- 16-round **Feistel Network**

#### Feistel Structure
- Split input into:
  - `L₀` (32-bit)
  - `R₀` (32-bit)

Each round:
Lᵢ = Rᵢ₋₁
Rᵢ = Lᵢ₋₁ ⊕ F(Rᵢ₋₁, K)


#### S-Box
An **S-box** performs nonlinear substitution and is critical for cryptographic strength.

**Shortcomings**
- Key space: `2⁵⁶ ≈ 10¹⁷` (too small today)
- Vulnerable to parallel brute-force attacks

➡️ **3DES** introduced as mitigation.

---

### AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)

- Secure enough for modern use  
- Does **not** use a Feistel structure  
- Uses a **Substitution–Permutation Network**

---

### Block Cipher Security

A block cipher **alone** is *not* secure:
- Preserves statistical properties of plaintext

#### Solution: Randomization
- Choose random **IV**
- Encrypt:

M' = IV ⊕ M
C = Enc(K, M')


#### Security Definition
An encryption scheme is secure if **no PPT adversary** can distinguish encryptions with probability greater than:

½ + 1 / poly(λ)


Assumption: underlying block cipher behaves as a **pseudorandom function (PRF)**.

---

### Modes of Operation

- **ECB (Electronic Code Book)**  
  - Insecure (pattern leakage)

- **CBC (Cipher Block Chaining)**  
  - Uses IV and chaining

- **CFB (Cipher Feedback Mode)**  
  - Cipher output feeds next block

- **OFB (Output Feedback Mode)**  
  - Turns block cipher into stream cipher
