This subject has offered me a comprehensive understanding of how light, color, and various algorithms work together to enable computers to perform tasks that once seemed exclusive to human vision. Here’s a breakdown of some key concepts and techniques I’ve learned:</p> <h4 id="understanding-light-and-color"><strong>Understanding Light and Color</strong></h4> <p>Light is more than what we see; it’s electromagnetic radiation that interacts with our eyes, triggering processes that result in color perception. Human eyes contain rods for low-light vision and cones that detect color. The cones come in three types, each responding to different wavelengths of light, forming the basis of the <strong>tristimulus theory</strong>. This theory suggests that any color can be represented using three values corresponding to red, green, and blue (RGB). This understanding is crucial in computer vision, where <strong>color models</strong> like RGB, CIE XYZ, and CIELab are fundamental to image processing.</p> <h4 id="the-mechanics-of-image-sensors"><strong>The Mechanics of Image Sensors</strong></h4> <p>In exploring how images are captured, I learned about <strong>image sensors</strong> like CMOS and CCD, which convert light into electric charges and then into digitized image samples. This digitization process involves converting continuous signals into quantized samples, with proper sampling rates essential to avoid aliasing.</p> <p>Digital cameras use <strong>color filter arrays (CFA)</strong> to capture accurate color information by representing the real world through three color channels—red, green, and blue. <strong>Gamma correction</strong> maps these quantized samples into a domain that our eyes perceive as uniform, enhancing digital image quality.</p> <h4 id="the-concept-of-machine-vision"><strong>The Concept of Machine Vision</strong></h4> <p><strong>Machine vision</strong> involves a multistage process where each stage influences the next. This concept highlights the importance of <strong>image enhancement</strong> to make images suitable for specific applications. However, image capture often introduces <strong>distortions</strong> that degrade quality, requiring quantitative metrics to ensure accuracy.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/T3-Image-Quality-and-Enhancement-pdf.png" alt="Machine Vision" width="500"/></p> <p><strong>Noise</strong> is a challenge in digital imaging, arising from the analog components in cameras. It requires statistical methods for reduction to preserve useful information.</p> <h4 id="edge-detection-and-keypoint-detection"><strong>Edge Detection and Keypoint Detection</strong></h4> <p>Edge detection is vital in computer vision, as edges indicate boundaries and shapes. <strong>Gradient calculation</strong> detects these discontinuities in images. However, noise can affect edge detection, necessitating noise reduction techniques.</p> <p>The <strong>Canny edge detector</strong> is a robust method combining edge detection, thinning, tracing, and linking to produce clean edges. <strong>Keypoint detection</strong> follows, using algorithms like the <strong>Harris Corner Detector</strong> to identify points of interest in an image. The Harris Detector’s mathematical foundation, including eigenvalue analysis, ensures reliable keypoint detection.</p> <h4 id="advanced-techniques-sift-and-hough-transform"><strong>Advanced Techniques: SIFT and Hough Transform</strong></h4> <p>The <strong>SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform)</strong> algorithm is crucial for detecting, localizing, and describing keypoints, enabling robust object recognition across varying scales and orientations.</p> <p>The <strong>Hough transform</strong> locates shapes like lines and circles within an image. It converts the image into a binary edge map, generates shape parameters for each edge point, and accumulates these parameters in an array representing the parameter space. Peaks in this array correspond to likely shapes, facilitating shape localization.</p> <h4 id="segmentation-and-object-detection"><strong>Segmentation and Object Detection</strong></h4> <p><strong>Segmentation</strong> is essential for object detection, involving methods like clustering-based approaches, thresholding, and <strong>K-means clustering</strong>. Advanced techniques like <strong>mean shift clustering</strong> and <strong>normalized cuts (NCut)</strong> provide more precise segmentation in complex scenes.</p> <p><strong>Object detection</strong> involves identifying and localizing objects within images. Techniques such as <strong>face detection</strong> and <strong>pedestrian detection</strong> use specific features and classifiers to recognize and categorize objects, crucial for applications like surveillance and autonomous driving.</p> <h4 id="motion-estimation-and-optical-flow"><strong>Motion Estimation and Optical Flow</strong></h4> <p><strong>Motion estimation</strong> determines the movement of objects within image sequences. <strong>Optical flow</strong> calculates the apparent motion of brightness patterns across frames. Techniques like <strong>Horn and Schunck</strong> and <strong>Lucas and Kanade</strong> methods estimate optical flow, each offering different approaches to handling motion.</p> <h3 id="what-i-found-most-interesting-while-learning-about-computer-vision-algorithms">What I Found Most Interesting While Learning About Computer Vision Algorithms</h3> <p>Studying computer vision algorithms has been enlightening, revealing fascinating aspects of technology and human perception. Key points of appreciation include:</p> <h4 id="1-the-intricacies-of-human-vision"><strong>1. The Intricacies of Human Vision</strong></h4> <p>The complexity and capability of human vision are remarkable. I was amazed to learn that our eyes can perceive a spectrum of colors that digital devices cannot fully reproduce. The CIE 1931 color space models human color perception, highlighting the sophistication of our visual system compared to technology.</p> <h4 id="2-the-mathematical-foundations-of-computer-vision"><strong>2. The Mathematical Foundations of Computer Vision</strong></h4> <p>The extensive mathematical framework underlying computer vision is intriguing. Concepts like Gaussian distributions, the Central Limit Theorem, and the Fourier Transform illustrate how images can be analyzed as signals through mathematical lenses. This approach connects computer vision to broader areas of signal processing and applied mathematics.</p> <h3 id="what-i-dont-like">What I Don’t Like</h3> <p>While foundational formulas and algorithms are crucial, many have become somewhat redundant with the rise of deep learning and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Modern approaches have simplified and automated tasks that were once complex and algorithm-intensive. Consequently, some traditional methods and mathematical formulations have become less prominent, shifting the focus toward leveraging deep learning models for advanced and efficient image processing.</p> <h3 id="overall-experience">Overall Experience</h3> <p>I achieved a Distinction in the course. I feel significantly more knowledgeable about computer vision than before and am eager to apply this knowledge in practice.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="learning"/><category term="projects"/><category term="learning"/><category term="uow"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[My Learning on CSCI935]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">CSIT882 - Data Management Systems</title><link href="https://karangoel59.com/blog/2024/database/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="CSIT882 - Data Management Systems"/><published>2024-07-05T04:00:01+10:00</published><updated>2024-07-05T04:00:01+10:00</updated><id>https://karangoel59.com/blog/2024/database</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://karangoel59.com/blog/2024/database/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="csit882---data-management-systems">CSIT882 - Data Management Systems</h2> <p>This subject proved to be relatively straightforward, covering fundamental concepts in data management without introducing anything particularly groundbreaking.

This reliance led to a disorganized group project.</p> <p><strong>Lack of Discipline and Overconfidence</strong>: I was juggling four subjects in my first semester: Web Development, Python, Computer Vision, and Network Design. While I was familiar with most of these topics, I took Network Design too lightly. I skipped lectures, relied on lecture notes, and developed poor living habits, including staying up late.</p> <p><strong>No Networking</strong>: I realized my mistakes too late.

Unfortunately, it didn’t quite meet my expectations.</p> <p>While I didn’t learn much new in terms of content, the course did help me formalize how I approach research—how to systematically search for, validate, and evaluate information.</p> <p>I was reminded of something I first learned when I began studying science:</p> <blockquote> <p>Science is the intellectual and practical activity encompassing the systematic study of the structure and behavior of the physical and natural world through observation and experiment.</p> </blockquote> <p>I never fully appreciated how crucial the concepts of systematic, organized, and observation are until now.</p> <p>Science is fundamentally about observation, recording, theorizing, and testing. It’s not about belief—there’s nothing to “believe” in science. Science is a method, not a thing or an event.</p> <p>When people say they “believe in science,” they often misunderstand what science truly entails. Science is about the process, not belief.</p> <p>While I was not able to achieve a Distinction in this subject, I understand where I was lacking.</p> <p><strong>Time Management</strong>: I completed all my assignments for this subject at the last moment. This left me with no time for formal revision or to get feedback from the professor, which could have significantly improved my performance.</p> <p><strong>Overthinking</strong>: I wanted my assignments to go a certain way, focusing on the outcome and searching for evidence to support that outcome. But research isn’t about directing results; it’s about following the evidence wherever it leads.</p> <p><a href="/assets/pdf/Research.zip">Lectures</a><br/> <a href="/assets/pdf/Assignment1.pdf">Assignment 1</a><br/> <a href="/assets/pdf/Adversarial_attacks_in_AI_systems_7836685_Karan_Goel.pdf">Assignment 2</a><br/> <a href="https://karangoel59.com/blog/2024/myfirstproposal/">Proposal</a></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="learning"/><category term="projects,"/><category term="learning,"/><category term="uow"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[My Learning on CSIT940]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">CSIT883 - System Analysis and Project Management</title><link href="https://karangoel59.com/blog/2024/system-analysis/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="CSIT883 - System Analysis and Project Management"/><published>2024-07-05T04:00:01+10:00</published><updated>2024-07-05T04:00:01+10:00</updated><id>https://karangoel59.com/blog/2024/system-analysis</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://karangoel59.com/blog/2024/system-analysis/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="csit883---system-analysis-and-project-management">CSIT883 - System Analysis and Project Management</h2> <p>This subject proved to be more challenging than what i was expeting.</p> <h3 id="project-management-topics">Project Management Topics</h3> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Introduction to Project Management</strong>: This covers the fundamental concepts of project management, including definitions, methodologies, and the role of a project manager in guiding projects from initiation to completion.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Project Integration Management</strong>: Focuses on coordinating all aspects of the project, including developing project plans, ensuring alignment of project objectives, and managing changes and conflicts.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Project Scope Management</strong>: Involves defining and controlling what is included and excluded in the project.

Here’s the refined version of your overall review:</p> <hr/> <h3 id="overall-review">Overall Review</h3> <p>I received only 60% for this subject, just passing. The reasons for this are multifactorial, but I primarily attribute it to overconfidence and a lack of discipline and planning.</p> <p><strong>Overconfidence and Lack of Discipline</strong>: Learning from past mistakes with Strategic Network Design, I focused on the project and, seeing that it was going well, neglected lectures and even started skipping them. Additionally, staying up late made it difficult for me to attend early morning classes.</p> <p><strong>Planning</strong>: I feel I took on too much responsibility in the project and was lenient with non-working members, which inadvertently incentivized their behavior. While my involvement kept the project on track, I failed to properly manage resources and support team members. It was a group project, and I neglected the importance of effective resource management and team dynamics.</p> <h3 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h3> <p><strong>Discipline</strong>: Implement more discipline in your life. Learn from your mistakes, correct them, but do so with discipline and self-awareness to avoid repeating them. Don’t be overconfident when things are going well; stay mindful of your work.</p> <p><strong>Planning</strong>: Adhere to the plan and allow team members to handle their responsibilities. Guide them, but don’t take over their work. Let others grow, even if it deviates from your vision.</p> <p><a href="/assets/pdf/Project%20Management.zip">Lectures</a> <a href="https://karangoel59.com/blog/2024/project_management/">Project</a></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="learning"/><category term="projects"/><category term="learning"/><category term="uow"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[My Learning on CSIT883]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">CSIT884 - Web Development</title><link href="https://karangoel59.com/blog/2024/web/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="CSIT884 - Web Development"/><published>2024-07-05T04:00:01+10:00</published><updated>2024-07-05T04:00:01+10:00</updated><id>https://karangoel59.com/blog/2024/web</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://karangoel59.com/blog/2024/web/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="csit884---web-development">CSIT884 - Web Development</h2> <p>This course focused exclusively on frontend development.</p> <h3 id="overall-review">Overall Review</h3> <p>I achieved a High Distinction in this course with relatively little effort.

It’s about steering a project through the highs and lows, ensuring it aligns with both stakeholder expectations and strategic goals. I recently completed a Project Management class, which culminated in a detailed study of the Recreation and Wellness Intranet Project for Manage Your Health Inc. (MYH). This experience not only provided a deep dive into project management techniques but also offered practical insights into handling real-world challenges.</p> <h3 id="the-project-at-a-glance">The Project at a Glance</h3> <p>Manage Your Health Inc., a Fortune 500 global healthcare provider, initiated the Recreation and Wellness Intranet Project with a vision to enhance employee health while reducing costs. With 25,000 employees globally, the potential impact was significant. The project, with a modest budget of $200,000 and a six-month timeline, was aimed at saving approximately $600,000 annually over four years by engaging employees in health and wellness programs.</p> <h3 id="strategic-planning-and-execution">Strategic Planning and Execution</h3> <p>From the outset, meticulous planning was critical. The project was broken down into distinct phases:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Initiation and Planning:</strong> This included everything from stakeholder interviews to detailed requirement gathering. Tools like Gantt charts and work breakdown structures were pivotal in visualizing the project scope and schedule.</li> <li><strong>Design and Documentation:</strong> Focused on developing a user-friendly interface and integrating essential health management features while ensuring compliance with data privacy laws.</li> <li><strong>Quality Assurance and Risk Management:</strong> We conducted iterative usability tests and regular security assessments to ensure the system was robust and user-friendly.</li> </ul> <h3 id="leveraging-technology">Leveraging Technology</h3> <p>Technology played a central role in managing the project. We utilized GitHub for version control and task management, which proved invaluable for tracking progress and coordinating tasks among team members. Tools like Figma and Microsoft Suite helped in designing and presenting our ideas effectively.</p> <h3 id="overcoming-challenges">Overcoming Challenges</h3> <p>The journey wasn’t without its challenges. Time underestimation and unfamiliarity with new tools led to last-minute scrambles and additional training, which were significant learning opportunities. These hurdles underscored the importance of flexible project management and the need for adaptability in the face of unforeseen complications.</p> <h3 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h3> <p>The project taught us several key lessons:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Effective Communication:</strong> Using multiple communication channels ensured that all stakeholders, including remote team members, were consistently informed and engaged.</li> <li><strong>Detailed Planning and Monitoring:</strong> Continuous monitoring of the project plan and budget was crucial for staying on track and preemptively addressing potential issues.</li> <li><strong>Success Measurement:</strong> Regularly measuring the project’s impact on employee health outcomes helped in demonstrating its value and gathering support from senior management.</li> </ul> <h3 id="personal-notes">Personal Notes</h3> <p>On a personal note, one of the standout insights from managing this project was the crucial role of incentives in driving employee engagement. Throughout various team activities, I envisioned specific outcomes and strategies; however, the willingness of group members to go above and beyond was sometimes lacking. Unlike in a real-world scenario where employees might be driven by financial gains, benefits, or a shared vision of the company’s future, in a classroom setting, these motivational factors are absent. This experience underscored the importance of aligning team members’ efforts with clear, compelling incentives that resonate with their personal or professional goals. In the academic context, the lack of such incentives highlighted the challenge of inspiring voluntary extra effort and creativity.</p> <h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3> <p>This project was more than just an academic exercise; it was a profound learning experience that highlighted the real-world applications of project management theories. The skills acquired, from strategic planning to risk management, are invaluable assets that will undoubtedly aid in any future project management roles.</p> <p>As we wrapped up the project, the satisfaction of navigating through the complexities and delivering a solution that could potentially transform an organization’s health management approach was immensely rewarding. This project wasn’t just about managing tasks and timelines; it was about fostering a healthier workplace, proving once again that at the heart of every successful project is a commitment to making a difference.</p> <hr/> <p><a href="/assets/pdf/ProjectManagement_Report.pdf">Link to the Report</a></p> <p><a href="https://github.com/kgoel59/883-project-management">Link to the Github</a></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="learning"/><category term="projects"/><category term="health-wellness"/><category term="uow"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Exploring the intricate details of managing a complex health and wellness project from a university course perspective.]]></summary></entry></feed>
