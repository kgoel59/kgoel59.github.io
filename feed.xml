Proudly of Indian origin, you can call me Karan, KG, or Ken – whichever resonates with you.</p> <p>Now, you might be wondering, what’s the cause for celebration? Why am I so thrilled? The reason is simple yet significant: this site and the post you’re currently reading are officially published.</p> <p>You may ask, “What’s the big deal? The internet is flooded with countless blog posts.” True, and you’re right to wonder what sets mine apart. I’m just a software developer building a portfolio.</p> <p>Indeed, I’m not reinventing the wheel. This blog may contain familiar elements found in many others, but I’m not here to be different. I’m here for myself – for self-expression.</p> <p>As a software developer, I’ve always considered myself a procrastinator and a perfectionist. These traits often resulted in delayed plans and an inability to settle on anything. However, a recent revelation on New Year’s Day changed my perspective.</p> <p>I stumbled upon a LinkedIn post by a successful independent game developer friend, Nitin Verma, who shared valuable insights on achieving goals. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nitin-verma-a70356166_things-i-learned-about-achieving-goals-after-activity-7040347210957348865-T_ho/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">Read the post here</a>.</p> <ol> <li><strong>Define Your Goals:</strong> Clearly articulate what you want to achieve.</li> <li><strong>Break Goals Into Steps:</strong> Make them more manageable and less intimidating.</li> <li><strong>Create a Plan:</strong> Develop a detailed plan of action.</li> <li><strong>Take Action:</strong> Start working towards your goals immediately.</li> <li><strong>Monitor Progress:</strong> Celebrate small wins and learn from setbacks.</li> <li><strong>Stay Focused and Motivated:</strong> Keep your eye on the prize and persevere through challenges.</li> <li><strong>Adjust Your Plan:</strong> Be flexible and make changes if needed.</li> <li><strong>Persevere:</strong> Don’t give up, every step brings you closer to your dreams. This struck a chord with me. I realized that I have many software projects I want to complete, but my lack of focus and perseverance often left plans on the shelf.</li> </ol> <p>Even this blog – a project planned for years – suffered from my indecision about the technology to use. Whether delving into WordPress and PHP, exploring Ghost on a server, or recently diving into Next.js, my inconsistency held me back. This blog is my commitment to change. I’ll document my progress daily and strive to make it work.</p> <p>Thank you for reading this – I’m unsure who will, but I genuinely appreciate it. Here’s to the journey ahead! 🍺</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="dairy"/><category term="projects"/><category term="learning"/><category term="self-improvement"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Documenting my exploration in the realms of projects, learning, and self-discovery.]]></summary></entry></feed>
