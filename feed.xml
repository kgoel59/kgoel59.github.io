It bridges the gap between business process design and implementation, making it an essential tool in the toolkit of service-oriented software engineering (SOSE). In this week’s post, we’ll explore the basics of BPMN, its key components, types of activities, events, gateways, and the concept of tokens.</p> <h3 id="what-is-bpmn">What is BPMN?</h3> <p>BPMN stands for Business Process Model and Notation. It is a standardized graphical notation that allows businesses to document, model, and understand their processes in a clear and concise way. BPMN is particularly valuable because it is designed to be understood by all business stakeholders—business analysts, technical developers, and process participants alike.</p> <h3 id="why-bpmn-is-important">Why BPMN is Important</h3> <p>In the realm of SOSE, BPMN plays a crucial role in the design and orchestration of services. By modeling business processes using BPMN, organizations can visualize the flow of activities, identify inefficiencies, and ensure that all aspects of the business process align with organizational goals. This is particularly important in service-oriented environments where multiple services interact with each other in complex ways.</p> <h3 id="key-components-of-bpmn">Key Components of BPMN</h3> <p>BPMN diagrams are composed of several core elements that represent different aspects of a business process. These include:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Flow Objects:</strong> <ul> <li><strong>Events</strong></li> <li><strong>Activities</strong></li> <li><strong>Gateways</strong></li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Connecting Objects:</strong> <ul> <li><strong>Sequence Flows</strong></li> <li><strong>Message Flows</strong></li> <li><strong>Associations</strong></li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Swimlanes:</strong> <ul> <li><strong>Pools</strong></li> <li><strong>Lanes</strong></li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Artifacts:</strong> <ul> <li><strong>Data Objects</strong></li> <li><strong>Groups</strong></li> <li><strong>Annotations</strong></li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h3 id="types-of-activities-tasks-and-subprocesses">Types of Activities: Tasks and Subprocesses</h3> <p>Activities in BPMN represent the work being performed within a business process. They are primarily categorized into tasks and subprocesses.</p> <h4 id="tasks"><strong>Tasks</strong></h4> <p>A task is a basic unit of work that cannot be broken down further within the process context</p> <h4 id="subprocesses"><strong>Subprocesses</strong></h4> <p>A subprocess is a compound activity that encapsulates a set of tasks, providing a way to simplify and manage complex processes.</p> <h3 id="types-of-events-start-intermediate-and-end">Types of Events: Start, Intermediate, and End</h3> <p>Events in BPMN represent things that happen within a business process. These events are divided into three main types:</p> <h4 id="start-events"><strong>Start Events</strong></h4> <p>Start events initiate the process flow. Types include:</p> <ul> <li><strong>None Start Event:</strong> A simple start with no specific trigger.</li> <li><strong>Message Start Event:</strong> Triggered by the receipt of a message.</li> <li><strong>Timer Start Event:</strong> Begins the process at a specific time or after a defined period.</li> <li><strong>Conditional Start Event:</strong> Triggered when a condition becomes true.</li> <li><strong>Signal Start Event:</strong> Responds to a broadcast signal that can trigger multiple processes.</li> </ul> <h4 id="intermediate-events"><strong>Intermediate Events</strong></h4> <p>Intermediate events occur between the start and end events, affecting the flow of the process:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Catch Event:</strong> Waits for a trigger (e.g., message, timer, signal) before proceeding.</li> <li><strong>Throw Event:</strong> Generates a trigger that can influence the process or other processes.</li> <li><strong>Timer Intermediate Event:</strong> Introduces a delay or specifies timing within the process.</li> <li><strong>Message Intermediate Event:</strong> Indicates a point where the process sends or receives a message.</li> <li><strong>Error Intermediate Event:</strong> Handles errors that occur during the process.</li> <li><strong>Escalation Event:</strong> Used to indicate an escalation in a process, typically signaling a higher priority action.</li> </ul> <h4 id="end-events"><strong>End Events</strong></h4> <p>End events signify the completion of the process. Types include:</p> <ul> <li><strong>None End Event:</strong> Marks the simple end of a process.</li> <li><strong>Message End Event:</strong> Sends a final message when the process ends.</li> <li><strong>Error End Event:</strong> Indicates that the process ended due to an error.</li> <li><strong>Terminate End Event:</strong> Ends the entire process immediately, regardless of other ongoing activities.</li> <li><strong>Signal End Event:</strong> Broadcasts a signal that other processes can respond to.</li> </ul> <h3 id="types-of-gateways">Types of Gateways</h3> <p>Gateways control the divergence and convergence of the process flow. They represent decision points, where the process can take multiple paths. Types of gateways include:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Exclusive Gateway (XOR):</strong> Allows only one of several paths to be taken, based on conditions.</li> <li><strong>Parallel Gateway (AND):</strong> Allows multiple paths to be taken simultaneously.</li> <li><strong>Inclusive Gateway (OR):</strong> One or more paths can be taken based on conditions.</li> <li><strong>Event-Based Gateway:</strong> Directs the flow based on an event that occurs.</li> <li><strong>Complex Gateway:</strong> Combines multiple types of decision criteria, allowing for more advanced control.</li> </ul> <h3 id="the-concept-of-tokens-in-bpmn">The Concept of Tokens in BPMN</h3> <p>In BPMN, the concept of a token is used to represent the flow of control within a process. A token is an abstract representation of a process instance moving through the model. When a process is initiated, a token is created and it moves through the sequence flows, activities, and gateways.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Token and Activities:</strong> As the token moves through an activity, it represents the execution of that activity.</li> <li><strong>Token and Gateways:</strong> When a token reaches a gateway, the type of gateway determines how the token will proceed. For example, an exclusive gateway will allow the token to pass through only one of the available paths, while a parallel gateway will split the token into multiple tokens, one for each path.</li> </ul> <p>The movement of tokens through a BPMN diagram helps visualize how a process flows from start to end, including how decisions and parallel activities are handled.</p> <h3 id="bpmn-in-action">BPMN in Action</h3> <p>Let’s consider a simple example: an order processing system in an online store. Using BPMN, you could model the process starting from the customer placing an order, followed by order validation, payment processing, and finally, order fulfillment and delivery.</p> <ol> <li><strong>Start Event:</strong> The process begins with the customer placing an order.</li> <li><strong>Task:</strong> The system validates the order to ensure all information is correct.</li> <li><strong>Gateway:</strong> A decision is made whether the payment is successful.</li> <li><strong>Task:</strong> If successful, the order is sent to the warehouse for fulfillment.</li> <li><strong>End Event:</strong> The process concludes when the order is delivered to the customer.</li> </ol> <p>This simple diagram provides a clear and visual representation of the order process, making it easy to understand and analyze.</p> <h3 id="bpmn-and-sose">BPMN and SOSE</h3> <p>In SOSE, BPMN can be used to model the interactions between various services within a system. For example, in a service-oriented architecture, you might have services for customer management, order processing, inventory management, and shipping. BPMN allows you to model how these services interact, where the dependencies are, and how information flows between them.</p> <p>This not only helps in the design phase but also in monitoring and optimizing the processes once they are implemented. By using BPMN, you can ensure that your service architecture is aligned with business processes and is capable of adapting to changes in business needs.</p> <p><a href="/assets/pdf/sose/3.Business%20Process%20Modelling%20and%20Management.pdf">Lecture 3</a></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="learning"/><category term="projects"/><category term="learning"/><category term="uow"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[BPMN]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">CSCI935 - Computer Vision Algorithms and Systems</title><link href="https://karangoel59.com/blog/2024/computer-vision/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="CSCI935 - Computer Vision Algorithms and Systems"/><published>2024-07-05T04:00:01+10:00</published><updated>2024-07-05T04:00:01+10:00</updated><id>https://karangoel59.com/blog/2024/computer-vision</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://karangoel59.com/blog/2024/computer-vision/"><![CDATA[<h3 id="my-learning-from-computer-vision-algorithms">My Learning from Computer Vision Algorithms</h3> <p>As I progress through my journey in the Computer Vision Algorithms subject, I’ve come to appreciate the intricate details that shape how machines perceive and interpret visual data. This subject has offered me a comprehensive understanding of how light, color, and various algorithms work together to enable computers to perform tasks that once seemed exclusive to human vision. Here’s a breakdown of some key concepts and techniques I’ve learned:</p> <h4 id="understanding-light-and-color"><strong>Understanding Light and Color</strong></h4> <p>Light is more than what we see; it’s electromagnetic radiation that interacts with our eyes, triggering processes that result in color perception. Human eyes contain rods for low-light vision and cones that detect color. The cones come in three types, each responding to different wavelengths of light, forming the basis of the <strong>tristimulus theory</strong>. This theory suggests that any color can be represented using three values corresponding to red, green, and blue (RGB). This understanding is crucial in computer vision, where <strong>color models</strong> like RGB, CIE XYZ, and CIELab are fundamental to image processing.</p> <h4 id="the-mechanics-of-image-sensors"><strong>The Mechanics of Image Sensors</strong></h4> <p>In exploring how images are captured, I learned about <strong>image sensors</strong> like CMOS and CCD, which convert light into electric charges and then into digitized image samples. This digitization process involves converting continuous signals into quantized samples, with proper sampling rates essential to avoid aliasing.</p> <p>Digital cameras use <strong>color filter arrays (CFA)</strong> to capture accurate color information by representing the real world through three color channels—red, green, and blue. <strong>Gamma correction</strong> maps these quantized samples into a domain that our eyes perceive as uniform, enhancing digital image quality.</p> <h4 id="the-concept-of-machine-vision"><strong>The Concept of Machine Vision</strong></h4> <p><strong>Machine vision</strong> involves a multistage process where each stage influences the next. This concept highlights the importance of <strong>image enhancement</strong> to make images suitable for specific applications. However, image capture often introduces <strong>distortions</strong> that degrade quality, requiring quantitative metrics to ensure accuracy.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/T3-Image-Quality-and-Enhancement-pdf.png" alt="Machine Vision" width="500"/></p> <p><strong>Noise</strong> is a challenge in digital imaging, arising from the analog components in cameras. It requires statistical methods for reduction to preserve useful information.</p> <h4 id="edge-detection-and-keypoint-detection"><strong>Edge Detection and Keypoint Detection</strong></h4> <p>Edge detection is vital in computer vision, as edges indicate boundaries and shapes. <strong>Gradient calculation</strong> detects these discontinuities in images. However, noise can affect edge detection, necessitating noise reduction techniques.</p> <p>The <strong>Canny edge detector</strong> is a robust method combining edge detection, thinning, tracing, and linking to produce clean edges. <strong>Keypoint detection</strong> follows, using algorithms like the <strong>Harris Corner Detector</strong> to identify points of interest in an image. The Harris Detector’s mathematical foundation, including eigenvalue analysis, ensures reliable keypoint detection.</p> <h4 id="advanced-techniques-sift-and-hough-transform"><strong>Advanced Techniques: SIFT and Hough Transform</strong></h4> <p>The <strong>SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform)</strong> algorithm is crucial for detecting, localizing, and describing keypoints, enabling robust object recognition across varying scales and orientations.</p> <p>The <strong>Hough transform</strong> locates shapes like lines and circles within an image. It converts the image into a binary edge map, generates shape parameters for each edge point, and accumulates these parameters in an array representing the parameter space. Peaks in this array correspond to likely shapes, facilitating shape localization.</p> <h4 id="segmentation-and-object-detection"><strong>Segmentation and Object Detection</strong></h4> <p><strong>Segmentation</strong> is essential for object detection, involving methods like clustering-based approaches, thresholding, and <strong>K-means clustering</strong>. Advanced techniques like <strong>mean shift clustering</strong> and <strong>normalized cuts (NCut)</strong> provide more precise segmentation in complex scenes.</p> <p><strong>Object detection</strong> involves identifying and localizing objects within images. Techniques such as <strong>face detection</strong> and <strong>pedestrian detection</strong> use specific features and classifiers to recognize and categorize objects, crucial for applications like surveillance and autonomous driving.</p> <h4 id="motion-estimation-and-optical-flow"><strong>Motion Estimation and Optical Flow</strong></h4> <p><strong>Motion estimation</strong> determines the movement of objects within image sequences. <strong>Optical flow</strong> calculates the apparent motion of brightness patterns across frames. Techniques like <strong>Horn and Schunck</strong> and <strong>Lucas and Kanade</strong> methods estimate optical flow, each offering different approaches to handling motion.</p> <h3 id="what-i-found-most-interesting-while-learning-about-computer-vision-algorithms">What I Found Most Interesting While Learning About Computer Vision Algorithms</h3> <p>Studying computer vision algorithms has been enlightening, revealing fascinating aspects of technology and human perception. Key points of appreciation include:</p> <h4 id="1-the-intricacies-of-human-vision"><strong>1. The Intricacies of Human Vision</strong></h4> <p>The complexity and capability of human vision are remarkable. I was amazed to learn that our eyes can perceive a spectrum of colors that digital devices cannot fully reproduce. The CIE 1931 color space models human color perception, highlighting the sophistication of our visual system compared to technology.</p> <h4 id="2-the-mathematical-foundations-of-computer-vision"><strong>2. The Mathematical Foundations of Computer Vision</strong></h4> <p>The extensive mathematical framework underlying computer vision is intriguing. Concepts like Gaussian distributions, the Central Limit Theorem, and the Fourier Transform illustrate how images can be analyzed as signals through mathematical lenses. This approach connects computer vision to broader areas of signal processing and applied mathematics.</p> <h3 id="what-i-dont-like">What I Don’t Like</h3> <p>While foundational formulas and algorithms are crucial, many have become somewhat redundant with the rise of deep learning and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Modern approaches have simplified and automated tasks that were once complex and algorithm-intensive. Consequently, some traditional methods and mathematical formulations have become less prominent, shifting the focus toward leveraging deep learning models for advanced and efficient image processing.</p> <h3 id="overall-experience">Overall Experience</h3> <p>I achieved a Distinction in the course. I feel significantly more knowledgeable about computer vision than before and am eager to apply this knowledge in practice.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="learning"/><category term="projects"/><category term="learning"/><category term="uow"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[My Learning on CSCI935]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">CSIT882 - Data Management Systems</title><link href="https://karangoel59.com/blog/2024/database/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="CSIT882 - Data Management Systems"/><published>2024-07-05T04:00:01+10:00</published><updated>2024-07-05T04:00:01+10:00</updated><id>https://karangoel59.com/blog/2024/database</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://karangoel59.com/blog/2024/database/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="csit882---data-management-systems">CSIT882 - Data Management Systems</h2> <p>This subject proved to be relatively straightforward, covering fundamental concepts in data management without introducing anything particularly groundbreaking.
