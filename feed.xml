These are fundamental techniques in data science and analytics, providing the groundwork for data-driven decision-making and pattern recognition in large datasets.</p> <h4 id="hypothesis-testing">Hypothesis Testing</h4> <p>Hypothesis testing is a statistical method that allows us to make inferences about a population based on sample data. The process involves testing an assumption, known as the <strong>null hypothesis (H0)</strong>, against an alternative hypothesis (HA). Depending on the nature of the data and the specific hypotheses being tested, different types of tests can be applied.</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Studentâ€™s t-test</strong>: Used when comparing the means of two populations that are normally distributed with similar variances.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Welchâ€™s t-test</strong>: Similar to the Studentâ€™s t-test but used when the populations have different variances.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test</strong>: A non-parametric test used when the populations are not normally distributed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)</strong>: Applied when comparing the means of more than two populations. ANOVA checks if at least one pair of population means differ.</p> <ul> <li><strong>One-Way ANOVA</strong>: Involves one independent factor.</li> <li><strong>Two-Way ANOVA</strong>: Involves two independent factors.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Limitations of ANOVA</strong>:</p> <ul> <li>Assumes data is normally distributed.</li> <li>Sensitive to outliers.</li> <li>Does not specify which pairs of means are different, requiring further analysis with tests like HSD (Honest Significant Difference).</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <h4 id="clustering-analysis">Clustering Analysis</h4> <p>Clustering is a method of unsupervised learning that groups a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (or cluster) are more similar to each other than to those in other groups. We covered three major clustering algorithms:</p> <ol> <li><strong>K-Means Clustering</strong>: <ul> <li>A hard clustering algorithm where each object is a point in an n-dimensional space.</li> <li>Objects are clustered based on their proximity to k randomly initialized centroids.</li> <li>The algorithm iteratively assigns points to the nearest centroid and updates the centroids until convergence.</li> <li>Commonly used in image processing, medical diagnosis, and data compression.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Challenges</strong>:</p> <ul> <li>Sensitive to noise and outliers.</li> <li>May result in empty clusters or vary in density.</li> <li>Dependent on the initial positioning of centroids, which may require multiple runs.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)</strong>: <ul> <li>Locates regions of high density that are separated by regions of low density.</li> <li>Classifies points as core points, border points, or noise points based on a density threshold (MinPts) and a radius (Eps).</li> <li>Resistant to noise and outliers, and capable of handling clusters of varying shapes and sizes.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Limitations</strong>:</p> <ul> <li>Struggles with varying densities.</li> <li>Not well-suited for sparse or high-dimensional data without additional techniques.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Self-Organizing Maps (SOM)</strong>: <ul> <li>A type of neural network used for clustering and visualization.</li> <li>Projects high-dimensional data onto a lower-dimensional space while preserving the topology.</li> <li>Useful for data visualization and exploration, especially when dealing with missing values or new data.</li> </ul> <p><strong>When Not to Use SOM</strong>:</p> <ul> <li>Data is very sparse.</li> <li>The resolution of the map is limited.</li> <li>Lack of multi-core computational resources.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3> <p>This weekâ€™s focus on hypothesis testing and clustering provides a foundation for understanding and applying these methods in big data analytics. Each technique has its strengths and limitations, and the choice of method depends on the nature of the data and the specific problem at hand. Whether testing hypotheses or uncovering hidden patterns in data, these tools are essential for effective data analysis.</p> <p><a href="/assets/pdf/bigdata/w4-Clustering.pdf">Lecture 3</a></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="learning"/><category term="projects"/><category term="learning"/><category term="uow"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Clustering]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">CSCI971 - Modern Cryptography Week 3</title><link href="https://karangoel59.com/blog/2024/crypto-week3/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="CSCI971 - Modern Cryptography Week 3"/><published>2024-08-10T01:09:00+10:00</published><updated>2024-08-10T01:09:00+10:00</updated><id>https://karangoel59.com/blog/2024/crypto-week3</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://karangoel59.com/blog/2024/crypto-week3/"><![CDATA[<p>How to construct symmetric key encription</p> <p>We will use computer complexity and check if scheme is secure</p> <p>Roadmap Classic Cipher = Ceaser Cipher (algo based) One time pad = Shannon</p> <p>How to design a block cipher</p> <p>Confusion and Diffusion: Design Principles</p> <p>Confusion = if a single bit key is changed, cypher text is significantly different Diffusion = if a single bit in plaintext is changed, cypher text is significantly different</p> <p>Change in plain text and and key result significant change in cypher text</p> <p>This is called avalanche effect</p> <p>Block Cipher Message -&gt; Enc(key) -&gt; Cipher -&gt; Dec(key) -&gt; Message</p> <p>Typical block size 64 bits 128 bits</p> <p>Common Design Approaches iterated cipher =&gt; each iteration is called round.

It bridges the gap between business process design and implementation, making it an essential tool in the toolkit of service-oriented software engineering (SOSE). In this weekâ€™s post, weâ€™ll explore the basics of BPMN, its key components, types of activities, events, gateways, and the concept of tokens.</p> <h3 id="what-is-bpmn">What is BPMN?</h3> <p>BPMN stands for Business Process Model and Notation. It is a standardized graphical notation that allows businesses to document, model, and understand their processes in a clear and concise way. BPMN is particularly valuable because it is designed to be understood by all business stakeholdersâ€”business analysts, technical developers, and process participants alike.</p> <h3 id="why-bpmn-is-important">Why BPMN is Important</h3> <p>In the realm of SOSE, BPMN plays a crucial role in the design and orchestration of services. By modeling business processes using BPMN, organizations can visualize the flow of activities, identify inefficiencies, and ensure that all aspects of the business process align with organizational goals. This is particularly important in service-oriented environments where multiple services interact with each other in complex ways.</p> <h3 id="key-components-of-bpmn">Key Components of BPMN</h3> <p>BPMN diagrams are composed of several core elements that represent different aspects of a business process. These include:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Flow Objects:</strong> <ul> <li><strong>Events</strong></li> <li><strong>Activities</strong></li> <li><strong>Gateways</strong></li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Connecting Objects:</strong> <ul> <li><strong>Sequence Flows</strong></li> <li><strong>Message Flows</strong></li> <li><strong>Associations</strong></li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Swimlanes:</strong> <ul> <li><strong>Pools</strong></li> <li><strong>Lanes</strong></li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Artifacts:</strong> <ul> <li><strong>Data Objects</strong></li> <li><strong>Groups</strong></li> <li><strong>Annotations</strong></li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h3 id="types-of-activities-tasks-and-subprocesses">Types of Activities: Tasks and Subprocesses</h3> <p>Activities in BPMN represent the work being performed within a business process. They are primarily categorized into tasks and subprocesses.</p> <h4 id="tasks"><strong>Tasks</strong></h4> <p>A task is a basic unit of work that cannot be broken down further within the process context</p> <h4 id="subprocesses"><strong>Subprocesses</strong></h4> <p>A subprocess is a compound activity that encapsulates a set of tasks, providing a way to simplify and manage complex processes.</p> <h3 id="types-of-events-start-intermediate-and-end">Types of Events: Start, Intermediate, and End</h3> <p>Events in BPMN represent things that happen within a business process. These events are divided into three main types:</p> <h4 id="start-events"><strong>Start Events</strong></h4> <p>Start events initiate the process flow. Types include:</p> <ul> <li><strong>None Start Event:</strong> A simple start with no specific trigger.</li> <li><strong>Message Start Event:</strong> Triggered by the receipt of a message.</li> <li><strong>Timer Start Event:</strong> Begins the process at a specific time or after a defined period.</li> <li><strong>Conditional Start Event:</strong> Triggered when a condition becomes true.</li> <li><strong>Signal Start Event:</strong> Responds to a broadcast signal that can trigger multiple processes.</li> </ul> <h4 id="intermediate-events"><strong>Intermediate Events</strong></h4> <p>Intermediate events occur between the start and end events, affecting the flow of the process:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Catch Event:</strong> Waits for a trigger (e.g., message, timer, signal) before proceeding.</li> <li><strong>Throw Event:</strong> Generates a trigger that can influence the process or other processes.</li> <li><strong>Timer Intermediate Event:</strong> Introduces a delay or specifies timing within the process.</li> <li><strong>Message Intermediate Event:</strong> Indicates a point where the process sends or receives a message.</li> <li><strong>Error Intermediate Event:</strong> Handles errors that occur during the process.</li> <li><strong>Escalation Event:</strong> Used to indicate an escalation in a process, typically signaling a higher priority action.</li> </ul> <h4 id="end-events"><strong>End Events</strong></h4> <p>End events signify the completion of the process. Types include:</p> <ul> <li><strong>None End Event:</strong> Marks the simple end of a process.</li> <li><strong>Message End Event:</strong> Sends a final message when the process ends.</li> <li><strong>Error End Event:</strong> Indicates that the process ended due to an error.</li> <li><strong>Terminate End Event:</strong> Ends the entire process immediately, regardless of other ongoing activities.</li> <li><strong>Signal End Event:</strong> Broadcasts a signal that other processes can respond to.</li> </ul> <h3 id="types-of-gateways">Types of Gateways</h3> <p>Gateways control the divergence and convergence of the process flow. They represent decision points, where the process can take multiple paths. Types of gateways include:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Exclusive Gateway (XOR):</strong> Allows only one of several paths to be taken, based on conditions.</li> <li><strong>Parallel Gateway (AND):</strong> Allows multiple paths to be taken simultaneously.</li> <li><strong>Inclusive Gateway (OR):</strong> One or more paths can be taken based on conditions.</li> <li><strong>Event-Based Gateway:</strong> Directs the flow based on an event that occurs.</li> <li><strong>Complex Gateway:</strong> Combines multiple types of decision criteria, allowing for more advanced control.</li> </ul> <h3 id="the-concept-of-tokens-in-bpmn">The Concept of Tokens in BPMN</h3> <p>In BPMN, the concept of a token is used to represent the flow of control within a process. A token is an abstract representation of a process instance moving through the model. When a process is initiated, a token is created and it moves through the sequence flows, activities, and gateways.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Token and Activities:</strong> As the token moves through an activity, it represents the execution of that activity.</li> <li><strong>Token and Gateways:</strong> When a token reaches a gateway, the type of gateway determines how the token will proceed. For example, an exclusive gateway will allow the token to pass through only one of the available paths, while a parallel gateway will split the token into multiple tokens, one for each path.</li> </ul> <p>The movement of tokens through a BPMN diagram helps visualize how a process flows from start to end, including how decisions and parallel activities are handled.</p> <h3 id="bpmn-in-action">BPMN in Action</h3> <p>Letâ€™s consider a simple example: an order processing system in an online store. Using BPMN, you could model the process starting from the customer placing an order, followed by order validation, payment processing, and finally, order fulfillment and delivery.</p> <ol> <li><strong>Start Event:</strong> The process begins with the customer placing an order.</li> <li><strong>Task:</strong> The system validates the order to ensure all information is correct.</li> <li><strong>Gateway:</strong> A decision is made whether the payment is successful.</li> <li><strong>Task:</strong> If successful, the order is sent to the warehouse for fulfillment.</li> <li><strong>End Event:</strong> The process concludes when the order is delivered to the customer.</li> </ol> <p>This simple diagram provides a clear and visual representation of the order process, making it easy to understand and analyze.</p> <h3 id="bpmn-and-sose">BPMN and SOSE</h3> <p>In SOSE, BPMN can be used to model the interactions between various services within a system. For example, in a service-oriented architecture, you might have services for customer management, order processing, inventory management, and shipping. BPMN allows you to model how these services interact, where the dependencies are, and how information flows between them.</p> <p>This not only helps in the design phase but also in monitoring and optimizing the processes once they are implemented. By using BPMN, you can ensure that your service architecture is aligned with business processes and is capable of adapting to changes in business needs.</p> <p><a href="/assets/pdf/sose/3.Business%20Process%20Modelling%20and%20Management.pdf">Lecture 3</a></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="learning"/><category term="projects"/><category term="learning"/><category term="uow"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[BPMN]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">CSCI946 - Big Data Analytics Week 3</title><link href="https://karangoel59.com/blog/2024/big-data-week3/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="CSCI946 - Big Data Analytics Week 3"/><published>2024-08-06T01:09:00+10:00</published><updated>2024-08-06T01:09:00+10:00</updated><id>https://karangoel59.com/blog/2024/big-data-week3</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://karangoel59.com/blog/2024/big-data-week3/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2> <p>Data exploration is a critical stage in the data analytics lifecycle.
