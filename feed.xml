Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is at the forefront of this advancement, focusing on understanding the sentiment related to specific aspects within a text. In this blog post, I delve into our project on building an ABSA system using advanced machine learning techniques and the IMDB movie review dataset.</p> <h3 id="what-is-aspect-based-sentiment-analysis">What is Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis?</h3> <p>Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is a sub-discipline of sentiment analysis that not only discerns the general sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) expressed in text but also links this sentiment to specific aspects or features discussed in the text. For example, a movie review might say, “The storyline was captivating, but the cinematography was underwhelming.” Here, ABSA would identify ‘storyline’ and ‘cinematography’ as aspects and associate positive sentiment with the former and negative with the latter.</p> <h3 id="why-focus-on-movie-reviews">Why Focus on Movie Reviews?</h3> <p>Movie reviews are particularly challenging and rich for sentiment analysis. They contain a complex mix of emotions and viewpoints, often discussing multiple elements like acting, directing, screenplay, and music. This makes movie reviews an ideal candidate for developing and refining ABSA systems.</p> <h3 id="our-approach">Our Approach</h3> <h4 id="data-set-and-preprocessing">Data Set and Preprocessing</h4> <p>We utilized the IMDB movie review dataset, a popular resource for training sentiment analysis models that includes 50,000 reviews labeled as positive or negative. Our first step involved preprocessing this data, which included removing HTML tags, URLs, and non-standard characters, followed by sentence clause extraction and text lemmatization to refine the text for further analysis.</p> <h4 id="models-used">Models Used</h4> <p>We employed two main models for our analysis:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)</strong>: Known for their ability to detect spatial hierarchies in data, CNNs were used to parse the reviews for general sentiments. They performed well, achieving an accuracy of 89%.</li> <li><strong>Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs)</strong>: These are adept at capturing long-term dependencies in text data, crucial for reviews where context plays a significant role. The LSTM model showed an accuracy of 87%.</li> </ul> <h4 id="aspect-extraction-and-sentiment-classification">Aspect Extraction and Sentiment Classification</h4> <p>For extracting aspects, we used Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify prevalent topics within the reviews. We then classified these aspects into categories such as actors, plot, music, and director, using our trained models to assign sentiment scores.</p> <h3 id="challenges-and-innovations">Challenges and Innovations</h3> <p>One of the primary challenges was the integration of aspect extraction with sentiment analysis. Aspect extraction required pinpointing specific phrases within large text blocks and determining their sentiment contextually. We tackled this by combining LDA for aspect identification with neural networks for sentiment classification, which proved effective but computationally intensive.</p> <h3 id="experiments-and-findings">Experiments and Findings</h3> <p>We conducted several experiments to compare model performance and the impact of different tokenization methods on these models. Our findings showed that while both CNN and LSTM are capable of performing sentiment analysis effectively, CNNs slightly outperformed LSTMs in our tests.</p> <h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3> <p>The project demonstrated the potential of using advanced machine learning techniques for aspect-based sentiment analysis. Although there were challenges, particularly in integrating different NLP techniques effectively, the outcomes highlighted the nuanced capabilities of ABSA in dissecting and understanding complex sentiment expressions within movie reviews.</p> <h3 id="future-work">Future Work</h3> <p>Looking ahead, we aim to refine our models to better handle the nuances of aspect identification and to explore the integration of more sophisticated tokenization techniques, such as those offered by BERT, to enhance our system’s understanding of context and sentiment.</p> <p>We invite feedback and discussions on this project, so please share your thoughts and comments below!</p> <hr/> <p><a href="/assets/pdf/Aspect_based_sentiment_analysis__A_study_of_the_IMDB_review_database_group_at.pdf">Link to the Report</a></p> <p><a href="https://github.com/kgoel59/Aspect-Based-Sentiment-Analysis-IMDB">Link to the Code</a></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="learning"/><category term="projects"/><category term="learning"/><category term="uow"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Aspect based system using machine learning and IMDB movie review dataset.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Hills and Valleys of Project Management: An Insightful Journey</title><link href="https://karangoel59.com/blog/2024/project_management/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Hills and Valleys of Project Management: An Insightful Journey"/><published>2024-06-01T01:00:00+10:00</published><updated>2024-06-01T01:00:00+10:00</updated><id>https://karangoel59.com/blog/2024/project_management</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://karangoel59.com/blog/2024/project_management/"><![CDATA[<p>Project management, often viewed through the lens of business and technology, encompasses much more. It’s about steering a project through the highs and lows, ensuring it aligns with both stakeholder expectations and strategic goals. I recently completed a Project Management class, which culminated in a detailed study of the Recreation and Wellness Intranet Project for Manage Your Health Inc. (MYH). This experience not only provided a deep dive into project management techniques but also offered practical insights into handling real-world challenges.</p> <h3 id="the-project-at-a-glance">The Project at a Glance</h3> <p>Manage Your Health Inc., a Fortune 500 global healthcare provider, initiated the Recreation and Wellness Intranet Project with a vision to enhance employee health while reducing costs. With 25,000 employees globally, the potential impact was significant. The project, with a modest budget of $200,000 and a six-month timeline, was aimed at saving approximately $600,000 annually over four years by engaging employees in health and wellness programs.</p> <h3 id="strategic-planning-and-execution">Strategic Planning and Execution</h3> <p>From the outset, meticulous planning was critical. The project was broken down into distinct phases:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Initiation and Planning:</strong> This included everything from stakeholder interviews to detailed requirement gathering. Tools like Gantt charts and work breakdown structures were pivotal in visualizing the project scope and schedule.</li> <li><strong>Design and Documentation:</strong> Focused on developing a user-friendly interface and integrating essential health management features while ensuring compliance with data privacy laws.</li> <li><strong>Quality Assurance and Risk Management:</strong> We conducted iterative usability tests and regular security assessments to ensure the system was robust and user-friendly.</li> </ul> <h3 id="leveraging-technology">Leveraging Technology</h3> <p>Technology played a central role in managing the project. We utilized GitHub for version control and task management, which proved invaluable for tracking progress and coordinating tasks among team members. Tools like Figma and Microsoft Suite helped in designing and presenting our ideas effectively.</p> <h3 id="overcoming-challenges">Overcoming Challenges</h3> <p>The journey wasn’t without its challenges. Time underestimation and unfamiliarity with new tools led to last-minute scrambles and additional training, which were significant learning opportunities. These hurdles underscored the importance of flexible project management and the need for adaptability in the face of unforeseen complications.</p> <h3 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h3> <p>The project taught us several key lessons:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Effective Communication:</strong> Using multiple communication channels ensured that all stakeholders, including remote team members, were consistently informed and engaged.</li> <li><strong>Detailed Planning and Monitoring:</strong> Continuous monitoring of the project plan and budget was crucial for staying on track and preemptively addressing potential issues.</li> <li><strong>Success Measurement:</strong> Regularly measuring the project’s impact on employee health outcomes helped in demonstrating its value and gathering support from senior management.</li> </ul> <h3 id="personal-notes">Personal Notes</h3> <p>On a personal note, one of the standout insights from managing this project was the crucial role of incentives in driving employee engagement. Throughout various team activities, I envisioned specific outcomes and strategies; however, the willingness of group members to go above and beyond was sometimes lacking. Unlike in a real-world scenario where employees might be driven by financial gains, benefits, or a shared vision of the company’s future, in a classroom setting, these motivational factors are absent. This experience underscored the importance of aligning team members’ efforts with clear, compelling incentives that resonate with their personal or professional goals. In the academic context, the lack of such incentives highlighted the challenge of inspiring voluntary extra effort and creativity.</p> <h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3> <p>This project was more than just an academic exercise; it was a profound learning experience that highlighted the real-world applications of project management theories. The skills acquired, from strategic planning to risk management, are invaluable assets that will undoubtedly aid in any future project management roles.</p> <p>As we wrapped up the project, the satisfaction of navigating through the complexities and delivering a solution that could potentially transform an organization’s health management approach was immensely rewarding. This project wasn’t just about managing tasks and timelines; it was about fostering a healthier workplace, proving once again that at the heart of every successful project is a commitment to making a difference.</p> <hr/> <p><a href="/assets/pdf/ProjectManagement_Report.pdf">Link to the Report</a></p> <p><a href="https://github.com/kgoel59/883-project-management">Link to the Github</a></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="learning"/><category term="projects"/><category term="health-wellness"/><category term="uow"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Exploring the intricate details of managing a complex health and wellness project from a university course perspective.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">A Joyful Return: Lord Rama’s Homecoming in Ayodhya</title><link href="https://karangoel59.com/blog/2024/festival-thoughts/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A Joyful Return: Lord Rama’s Homecoming in Ayodhya"/><published>2024-01-23T02:01:00+11:00</published><updated>2024-01-23T02:01:00+11:00</updated><id>https://karangoel59.com/blog/2024/festival-thoughts</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://karangoel59.com/blog/2024/festival-thoughts/"><![CDATA[<p>Hello Everyone,</p> <p>Today marked a momentous occasion for Hindus worldwide, and as one of them, I feel compelled to share this extraordinary day with you.</p> <p>After a hiatus of 500 years, Lord Rama has returned to Ayodhya, and the experience has been nothing short of magical.</p> <p>I must admit, prior to today, I didn’t pay much attention to the temple issue.

Proudly of Indian origin, you can call me Karan, KG, or Ken – whichever resonates with you.</p> <p>Now, you might be wondering, what’s the cause for celebration? Why am I so thrilled? The reason is simple yet significant: this site and the post you’re currently reading are officially published.</p> <p>You may ask, “What’s the big deal? The internet is flooded with countless blog posts.” True, and you’re right to wonder what sets mine apart. I’m just a software developer building a portfolio.</p> <p>Indeed, I’m not reinventing the wheel. This blog may contain familiar elements found in many others, but I’m not here to be different. I’m here for myself – for self-expression.</p> <p>As a human, I’ve always considered myself a procrastinator and a perfectionist. These traits often resulted in delayed plans and an inability to settle on anything. However, a recent revelation on New Year’s Day changed my perspective.</p> <p>I stumbled upon a LinkedIn post by a successful independent game developer friend, Nitin Verma, who shared valuable insights on achieving goals. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nitin-verma-a70356166_things-i-learned-about-achieving-goals-after-activity-7040347210957348865-T_ho/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">Read the post here</a>.</p> <ol> <li><strong>Define Your Goals:</strong> Clearly articulate what you want to achieve.</li> <li><strong>Break Goals Into Steps:</strong> Make them more manageable and less intimidating.</li> <li><strong>Create a Plan:</strong> Develop a detailed plan of action.</li> <li><strong>Take Action:</strong> Start working towards your goals immediately.</li> <li><strong>Monitor Progress:</strong> Celebrate small wins and learn from setbacks.</li> <li><strong>Stay Focused and Motivated:</strong> Keep your eye on the prize and persevere through challenges.</li> <li><strong>Adjust Your Plan:</strong> Be flexible and make changes if needed.</li> <li><strong>Persevere:</strong> Don’t give up, every step brings you closer to your dreams.</li> </ol> <p>This struck a chord with me. I realized that I have many software projects I want to complete, but my lack of focus and perseverance often left plans on the shelf.</p> <p>Even this blog – a project planned for years – suffered from my indecision about the technology to use.
