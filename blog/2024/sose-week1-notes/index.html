Technology neutral: they must be invocable through standardized lowest common denominator technologies that are available to almost all IT environments. This implies that the invocation mechanisms (protocols, descriptions and discovery mechanisms) should comply with widely accepted standards. • Loosely coupled: they must not require knowledge or any internal structures or conventions (context) at the client or service side. • Support location transparency: services should have their definitions and location information stored in a repository such as UDDI and be accessible by a variety of clients that can locate and invoke the services irrespective of their location. Service comes in two flavour simple and composite Composite services involve assembling existing services that access and combine information and functions from possibly multiple ser- vice providers. Accordingly, services help integrate applications that were not written with the intent to be easily integrated with other distributed applications and define architectures and techniques to build new functionality while integrating existing application functionality. Service-based applications are developed as independent sets of interacting services offering nor does it require pre determined agreements to be put into place before the use of an offered service is allow A web service is a specific kind of service that is identified by a URI and exhibits the following characteristics: • It exposes its features programmatically over the Internet using standard Internet languages and protocols, and • It can be implemented via a self-describing interface based on open Internet standards (e.g., XML interfaces which are published in a network-based repositories). Interactions of web-services occur as SOAP calls carrying XML data content and the service descriptions of the web-services are expressed using WSDL [15] as the common (XML-based) standard. WSDL is used to publish a web service in terms of its ports (addresses implementing this service), port types (the abstract definition of operations and exchanges of messages), and bindings (the concrete definition of which packaging and transportation protocols such as SOAP are used to inter-connect two conversing end points). The UDDI [14] standard is a directory service that contains service publications and enables web-service clients to locate candidate services and discover their details. The concept of software-as-a-service espoused by SOC is revolutionary and appeared first with the ASP (Applications Service Provider) software mode The SOC paradigm allows the software-as-a-service concept to expand to include the delivery of complex business processes and transactions as a service, while permitting applications be constructed on the fly and services to be reused everywhere and by anybody To build integration-ready applications the service model relies on the service-oriented architecture (SOA). SOA is a way of reorganizing a portfolio of previously siloed software applications and support infrastructure into an interconnected set of services, each accessible through standard interfaces and messaging protocols The basic SOA defines an interaction between software agents as an exchange of messages between service requesters (clients) and service providers. Clients are software agents that request the execution of a service. Providers are software agents that provide the service. Agents can be simultaneously both service clients and provider Providers are responsible for desscription of the service(s) they provide. Clients must able to find the description(s) of the services they require and must be able to bind to them The basic SOA is not an architecture only about services, it is a relationship of three kinds of participants: the service provider, the service discovery agency, and the service requestor (client). The interactions involve the publish, find and bind operations The service provider defines a service description of the service and publishes it to a client or service discovery agency through which a service description is published and made discoverable Black box encapsulation inherits this feature from the principles of modularity in software engineering, e.g., modules, objects and components Reliable Design Without Implementation Knowledge: By defining the service specification, you can design and integrate services without needing to understand the internal implementations of the imported services. This abstraction allows you to compose services based on their interfaces and interactions, ensuring that you can design reliable service compositions. The basic SOA does not address overarching concerns such as management, service orchestration, service transaction management and coordination, security, and other concerns that apply to all components in a services architecture. Such concerns are addressed by the extended SOA (ESOA) The service composition layer in the ESOA encompasses necessary roles and functionality for the consolidation of multiple services into a single composite service A service aggregator is a service provider that consolidates services that are provided by other service providers into a distinct value added service o manage critical applications/solutions and specific markets, ESOA provides managed services in the service management layer depicted at the top of the ESOA pyramid Grid services used in the ESOA’s service management layer to provide an enabling infrastructure for systems and applications that require the integration and management of services with the context of dynamic virtual market- places. Grid services provide the possibility to achieve end- to-end qualities of service and address critical application and system management concerns. This infrastructure is called the service grid bus. The service grid bus (SGB) provides a high-level ab- straction architecture and management facilities to allow services (within an open service marketplace) to function as an integral unit and collaborate with other services </div> </article> <br> <hr> <br> <ul class="list-disc pl-8"></ul> <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-12">Enjoy Reading This Article?</h2> <p class="mb-2">Here are some more articles you might like to read next:</p> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2024/sose-week1/">CSCI927 Service-Oriented Software Engineering Week 1</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2024/sose-week2/">CSCI927 Service-Oriented Software Engineering Week 2</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2024/sose-week3/">CSCI927 Service-Oriented Software Engineering Week 3</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2024/sose-week2-notes/">SOSE Week2</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2024/database/">CSIT882 - Data Management Systems</a> </li> <div id="giscus_thread" style="max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;"> <script>let giscusTheme=localStorage.getItem("theme"),giscusAttributes={src:"https://giscus.app/client.js","data-repo":"kgoel59/kgoel59.github.io","data-repo-id":"R_kgDOLGCvFA","data-category":"Q&A","data-category-id":"DIC_kwDOLGCvFM4CcfRJ","data-mapping":"title","data-strict":"1","data-reactions-enabled":"1","data-emit-metadata":"0","data-input-position":"bottom","data-theme":giscusTheme,"data-lang":"en",crossorigin:"anonymous",async:""},giscusScript=document.createElement("script");Object.entries(giscusAttributes).forEach(([t,e])=>giscusScript.setAttribute(t,e)),document.getElementById("giscus_thread").appendChild(giscusScript);</script> <noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://giscus.app/?ref_noscript" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">comments powered by giscus.</a> </noscript> </div> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2024 Karan Goel.
